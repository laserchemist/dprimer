# Elements of Data Science Primer

This Jupyter Book provides a brief primer on key topics including Python coding and statistics fundamentals

## What is Data Science?
Data science is beyond data, it is a scientific approach to analyzing data and drawing conclusions. Data sets can be developed from scientific experimentation and surveys. Computer coding is a key tool in loading data sets, exploring them, visualizing, and analyzing.

In this primer the Python computer language will be used given it's widespread use in data science and straightforward syntax.

Statistics is central to data science providing a systematic framework to analyze and draw conclusions from data.
